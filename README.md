Hi! I'm Mariusz, an Offensive Security afficionado. Been solving IT Security problems from both defensive and offensive sides of the barricade for more than 14 years by now out of which seven profesionally. I was always more attracted to sharing knowledge through my code, tools, scripts, exploits rather than writing blog posts. With that on the table, this Github account acts as my legacy. ðŸ˜„

I specialize in Windows & Networks security assessment. Started as a Malware Analyst, pushed my career through all sorts of technical roles & challenges to land myself in Red Team operator's shoes evaluating holistically my Customer's cyber-defensive programmes.
