Hi! I'm Mariusz, an Offensive Security afficionado. Been solving IT Security problems from both defensive and offensive sides of the barricade for more than 14 years by now out of which eight profesionally. I was always more attracted to sharing knowledge through my code, tools, scripts, exploits rather than writing blog posts. With that on the table, this Github account acts as my legacy. üòÑ

üéì My area of expertise is Windows & Networks security assessments. Started as a Malware Analyst, pushed my career through all sorts of technical roles & challenges to land myself in Red Team operator's shoes evaluating holistically my Customer's cyber-defensive programmes. 

I'm a holder of following cybersecurity/IT certificates: _CARTP, CRTE, CRTP, eCPTX, CCNA, CREST CRT, OSCP, OSCE, OSWP_ . 

‚ö° Welcome to my Github lair where you'll find all sorts of security-related tools of hopefully decent quality. 

‚ù§Ô∏è If you ever benefited from my projects, tools, scripts, pull requests - if you ever saw my work helpful to others, it would be really awesome if you could consider supporting these efforts through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/mgeeky">my Github Sponsors page</a>. You'll receive an exclusive access to my private repositories containing a few other high quality tools and utilities greatly improving Red Teams delivery. Show some love and support - consider buying me a coffee or better a beer - as a way of saying thank you! üí™

Cheers!
